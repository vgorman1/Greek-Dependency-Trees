# Greek-Dependency-Trees
A collection of hand-annotated dependency syntax trees of ancient Greek prose, using the Arethusa program available at the Perseids Project. This collection is being constantly edited (as mistakes are pointed out and corrected) and expanded with new files. All of these trees were annotated by one person: Vanessa Gorman (PhD Penn), Prof. of History, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

All new trees uploaded after January 2020, including all trees of Demosthenes (except for 4 and 18) were pre-parsed at the Pedalion Project by Toon Van Hal and Alek Keersmaekers and hand-corrected by V. Gorman. Many thanks!

The Guidelines included here are by Bamman and Crane (Greek) and Bamman, et al. (Latin) from the Perseids site.  Treebanking Tips is a sheet I have been developing over the years, explaining how I deal with troublesome constructions.
